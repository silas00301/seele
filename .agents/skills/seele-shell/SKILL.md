description: Develop Seele Shell and carry its Jujutsu-managed submodule changes through validation, commit, push, parent gitlink refresh, lock update, and rebuild-ready verification. Use for changes under seele-shell/ or when shell work must become consumable by the parent Seele flake.
---

# Seele Shell workflow

Treat `seele-shell/` and its parent as separate Jujutsu repositories. Use `jj -R seele-shell` for submodule history, and keep Git's staging area out of both workflows. The repository-owned parent helper uses Git internally because Jujutsu does not snapshot submodule gitlinks.

## Protect both working copies

Run from the parent root:

```sh
jj status
jj -R seele-shell status
jj -R seele-shell log -r '@ | @- | main | main@origin' --no-graph
```

Record pre-existing changes in each repository. Keep unrelated paths out of commits. A detached submodule HEAD is normal.

## Work and validate inside the submodule

Keep UI and runtime behavior in `seele-shell/`. Put parent-side service, package, theme, or Home Manager integration in the parent flake.

Use the narrowest package build that contains the change:

```sh
cd seele-shell
nix build .#default --no-link --no-write-lock-file
nix build .#greeter --no-link --no-write-lock-file
nix build .#lock --no-link --no-write-lock-file
nix build .#polkit --no-link --no-write-lock-file
```

The default package build compiles the Rust tools, runs `qmllint`, bundles the extensions, and runs the focused shell tests. Build every affected output when shared code changes. Use `nix develop -c test-shell` for a faster Rust and JavaScript loop, but finish with the relevant package build.

Inspect the submodule diff before crossing back into the parent:

```sh
jj -R seele-shell diff
jj -R seele-shell status
```

## Commit and push the submodule

Commit and push only when the user asked for a rebuild-ready result or otherwise authorized those history and remote changes.

Commit only the intended submodule paths. Jujutsu leaves every unselected change in the new working-copy commit:

```sh
jj -R seele-shell commit <paths> -m "<shell change>"
jj -R seele-shell status
```

Fetch the remote bookmark and inspect it against the new commit:

```sh
jj -R seele-shell git fetch --remote origin
jj -R seele-shell log -r 'main@origin | @-'
jj -R seele-shell log -r 'main@origin ~ ancestors(@-)' --no-graph
```

An empty result from the final command proves the push will be a fast-forward. If it prints a commit, rebase the local stack onto `main@origin` and resolve any conflicts before continuing:

```sh
jj -R seele-shell rebase -s 'roots(main@origin..@-)' -d main@origin
```

Move the local bookmark to the commit and push through Jujutsu's remote safety checks:

```sh
jj -R seele-shell bookmark set main -r @-
jj -R seele-shell git push --remote origin --bookmark main
jj -R seele-shell status
```

The parent helper requires a clean submodule, so leave the boundary here if unrelated submodule changes remain. Never discard or commit those changes just to satisfy the helper.

## Refresh the parent pointer

Return to the parent root and run:

```sh
nix run .#update-submodule
```

The helper verifies that the submodule is clean, commits only the parent gitlink through Git, imports that commit into Jujutsu, advances `main` to it when possible, and updates the `seele-shell` entry in `flake.lock`. Do not stage the parent gitlink manually.

Review the resulting parent state:

```sh
jj status
jj diff
```

Commit the refreshed lock and any intended companion parent changes with Jujutsu file selection so existing work stays separate:

```sh
jj commit flake.lock <companion-parent-paths> -m "Refresh Seele Shell"
jj bookmark set main -r @-
jj git push --bookmark main
```

Omit `<companion-parent-paths>` when the shell change has no parent-side code. Keep unrelated paths in the working-copy commit.

## Prove the parent consumes the new revision

The gitlink and lock must both match the pushed submodule commit:

```sh
shell_rev="$(jj -R seele-shell log -r @- --no-graph -T commit_id)"
gitlink_rev="$(git ls-tree main -- seele-shell | awk '$1 == "160000" { print $3 }')"
lock_rev="$(jq -r '.nodes["seele-shell"].locked.rev' flake.lock)"
test "$shell_rev" = "$gitlink_rev"
test "$shell_rev" = "$lock_rev"
```

Then run the parent Seele validation workflow. At minimum, format the parent, evaluate the flake and native host, build `packages.<system>.seele-shell`, and build the native host closure. A rebuild-ready result has a clean pushed submodule, matching gitlink and lock revisions, passing submodule and parent builds, and a pushed parent bookmark.

Activation is separate. Run `nh os switch`, `nh darwin switch`, or an equivalent activation command only when the user explicitly asks to change the live machine.
